% Problem 1
(a). 
pilots(A, london), pilots(london, paris) can not be unified, because if A = london, but london can not equal to pairs. so they can not be unified

(b). 
point(X, Y, Z), point(X1, Y1, Z1) can be unified, the mgu is {X=X1, Y=Y1, Z=Z1}

(c).
letter(C), word(letter) can not be unified, because when C = letter, but word = letter, so they can not be unified

(d).
noun(alpha), alpha can not be unified, because alpha is a variable in noun()

(e).
'student', student can be unified, the mug is {}(empty)

(f).
f(X, X), f(a, b) can not be unified, because when X = a, X =b, it is not the correct substitution 

(g).
 f(X, a(b, c)), f(Z, a(Z, c)) can be unified, the mgu is {X=Z, Z=b}

(h).
 f(c, a(b, c)), f(Z, a(Z, c)) can not be unified, because of when Z = c, Z can not be b, so they can not be unified

(i).
f(X, a(b, c)), f(d, a(Z, c)) can be unified, the mgu is {X=d, Z=b}

(j).g(Z, f(A, 17, B), A+B, 17), g(C, f(D, D, E), C, E) can be unified, the mgu is {Z=C, C=17+17, A=B, B=D, D=E, E=17}
